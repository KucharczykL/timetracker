# Timetracker

A simple game catalogue and play session tracker.

# Development

The project uses `pyenv` to manage installed Python versions.
If you have `pyenv` installed, you can simply run:

```
make init
```

This will make sure the correct Python version is installed, and it will install all dependencies using `poetry`.
Afterwards, you can start the development server using `make dev`.
